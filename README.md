## Description

The goal is to create a system in TypeScript that models the operational structure of a startup 
that facilitates citizens' access to state bonuses, focusing on the interactions between startups, 
state incentives and participating citizens. Through the definition of interfaces and classes representing 
the various components of the system (IStartup, IIncent, ICitizen), the project will illustrate how technology can 
facilitate access to incentives and participation in sports activities

This project was created for [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/)
